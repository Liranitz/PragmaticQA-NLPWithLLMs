        "\n",
        "The PragmatiCQA dataset addresses a critical gap in conversational AI evaluation by focusing on **pragmatic reasoning** - the ability to understand not just what is explicitly asked, but what the user likely wants to know based on conversational context and shared knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Motivations:**\n",
        "1. **Cooperative Communication**: Traditional QA systems provide literal answers, but human communication is cooperative - we often provide additional relevant information beyond what's explicitly requested.\n",
        "2. **Conversational Context**: Real conversations build on previous exchanges, requiring models to maintain context and infer user intent.\n",
        "3. **Asymmetric Information Access**: The dataset tests whether models can identify what additional information users might find valuable, even when not explicitly requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Contributions:**\n",
        "1. **Pragmatic vs Literal Distinction**: The dataset explicitly separates literal answers (answering exactly what was asked) from pragmatic answers (providing additional contextually relevant information).\n",
        "2. **Conversational Structure**: Multi-turn conversations test the model's ability to maintain context and build upon previous exchanges.\n",
        "3. **Fandom Domain**: Uses real-world fan communities where pragmatic reasoning is crucial for engaging conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Makes This Dataset Challenging\n",
        "\n",
        "The PragmatiCQA dataset targets several specific pragmatic phenomena:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Over-answering**: Providing more information than explicitly requested\n",
        "2. **Intent Inference**: Understanding what the user really wants to know\n",
        "3. **Conversational Coherence**: Maintaining context across multiple turns\n",
        "4. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Combining retrieved information with conversational context\n",
        "5. **Follow-up Question Prediction**: Anticipating what users might ask next\n",

        "## Discussion Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Comparison of Models\n",
        "\n",
        "**How did the performance of the \"traditional\" QA model compare to the LLM-based model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the evaluation results:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Traditional QA Model**: Shows varying performance across different context configurations. The pragmatic configuration typically performs best as it provides the most relevant context for generating cooperative answers.\n",
        "- **LLM-based Pragmatic RAG**: Generally outperforms traditional approaches by explicitly modeling conversational context and pragmatic reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Traditional QA Model:*\n",
        "- ✅ Fast and efficient\n",
        "- ✅ Deterministic outputs\n",
        "- ❌ Limited to literal question answering\n",
        "- ❌ Cannot leverage conversational context\n",
        "- ❌ No pragmatic reasoning capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "*LLM-based Model:*\n",
        "- ✅ Sophisticated pragmatic reasoning\n",
        "- ✅ Conversational context awareness\n",
        "- ✅ Cooperative answer generation\n",
        "- ❌ Higher computational cost\n",
        "- ❌ Less predictable outputs\n",
        "- ❌ Requires more complex setup\n",
        "\n",
        "**First vs Later Questions:**\n",
        "There is typically a difference between first questions and later questions in conversations. First questions have no conversational context, so both models perform similarly. Later questions benefit significantly from the LLM's ability to maintain and leverage conversational context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Theory of Mind\n",
        "\n",
        "**To what extent does the LLM-based model exhibit \"Theory of Mind\"?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM-based model demonstrates **limited but meaningful** Theory of Mind capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evidence of ToM:**\n",
        "- **Intent Inference**: The model attempts to understand what the user really wants to know beyond the literal question\n",
        "- **Contextual Reasoning**: It maintains awareness of previous conversation turns\n",
        "- **Cooperative Behavior**: It generates answers that anticipate follow-up questions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "- **Pattern Matching vs Understanding**: The model likely relies more on sophisticated pattern matching than true understanding\n",
        "- **Limited Generalization**: Performance may not generalize well to domains outside its training data\n",
        "- **No True Mental State Modeling**: The model doesn't truly model the user's beliefs, desires, or knowledge state\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Analysis:**\n",
        "When a user asks \"What year did The Legend of Zelda come out?\", the model not only provides the year but also adds context about regional releases and suggests follow-up questions. This suggests some level of understanding that the user might be interested in the broader context, though this could be learned pattern matching rather than true ToM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Optional Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retriever Performance Impact:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The end-to-end performance heavily depends on retriever quality. Potential improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **ColbertV2 Retriever**: More sophisticated retrieval with better semantic understanding\n",
        "2. **Top-k Parameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different numbers of retrieved passages\n",
        "3. **Chunking Strategies**: Better document segmentation using HTML structure\n",
        "4. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining multiple retrieval methods (semantic + keyword-based)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation Recommendations:**\n",
        "- Use HTML structure to create more meaningful chunks\n",
        "- Implement re-ranking of retrieved passages\n",
        "- Add query expansion based on conversation context\n",
