Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger . The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the Batcave , beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in Frank Miller 's 1986 Dark Knight series .

Contents 1 History 2 Gadgets 3 In other media 3.1 TV Series 3.2 Films 3.3 Video Games 4 Notes 5 See also History Before the familiar bat-finned cars, the title \"Batmobile\" was first used on a red convertible in Detective Comics #48 in February 1941. Most of the design was based on the 1936 Cord, though the nose of the car looked more like that of a Lincoln or similar car. The bat mask did not exist yet, but the car did sport a small \"bat\" hood ornament. Several \"Proto-Batmobiles\" had appeared in comics by this point, though this was the first to use the name. It was also the last car used before the now famous Batmobiles with the bat-masks and roof fins. Though very similar in design to the 1941 car, the progression of the 1950s saw the Batmobile change again for the sake artistic simplicity; hence, the \"bubble dome\" Batmobile was created. It retains many of the features of the previous car, with the major exception being the now separate dome over the passenger compartment. The car has also lost many of the curves of the previous car, being essentially a very long, thin box with the dome, fin, and \"bat nose\" features added. The on-board laboratory was lost, leaving only a two-passenger compartment under the dome. Many Batmobile fans dislike the overly simplified lines of this car, which would last until the next redesign came in the early 1960s. Another variation of the \"Futura Batmobile\" appeared in Detective Comics #374, used as Batman tracked down a criminal who nearly killed Robin .

While reading it on vacation in Mexico, Miranda began developing early ideas of a musical revolving Hamilton and his life. He began writing these ideas down, frequently shouting out ideas to his wife, Vanessa Nadal, as they came to mind. After researching, he found that a play by the life of Alexander Hamilton did exist, though it dated back to 1917. The first idea of Hamilton was brought up while Lin was at the bar with Jeremy McCarter. McCarter says \"...Lin-Manuel Miranda told me he wanted to write a hip-hop concept album about the life of Alexander Hamilton. For a second I thought we sharing a drunken joke. We were probably drunk, but he wasn't joking.\" Adapted from the biography, Miranda began to draft lyrics and music in his spare time from In The Heights , and created the production The Hamilton Mixtape , brought to life by the Vassar Workshop (with Alex Lacamoire on the piano). The workshop earned a showcase at New York Stage and Film and gained very positive reviews from famous Broadway personalities. Miranda was later invited to the White House's Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word , and, though he was set to perform music from In The Heights , he instead performed the opening number from",

It is located in the western quadrant of Oz called the Winkie Country . It stands in the very heart of the Winkie City. Description The Tin Woodman's palace is an enormous establishment entirely made of all polished tin that glistens in the rays of the sun like silver. Even the towers, domes and gables are constructed out of tin. Around the grounds of the tin castle runs a high tin wall with tin gates which are always open. The grounds contain pretty tin flower beds, tin fountains and life-size tin statues of all the Emperor's personal and dearest friends such as Dorothy Gale and Toto , the Scarecrow , the Cowardly Lion , Princess Ozma and many more. The paths are paved with sheets of tin and, though most of the flowers are real, there is a singular bed where tin camelias, tin marigolds, tin carnations, tin poppies, and tin hollyhocks are placed in the flower beds as well. Inside, all the furniture and decorations are made of brightly polished tin right down to the tables, chairs, beds and even all the ceilings, floors and walls. There are tin pictures hung up on the walls and from the tin ceilings hang handsome tin chandeliers. Many servants spend hours each and every day polishing the grounds to prevent the palace from rusting. History When Dorothy Gale killed the former ruler of the Winkie people, the Wicked Witch of the West , the Winkies then asked the Tin Woodman to take her place, and which he happily accepted. Since the home of the Wicked Witch was too old and damp, the Winkies built him a new castle to live in that they proudly built entirely of shiny tin.

Sheffer Publisher Reilly & Britton Publication date 1905 The Fate of a Crown is a 1905 adventure melodrama written by L. Frank Baum . It was Baum's first novel for an adult readership. The book was released under the pseudonym \"Schuyler Staunton.\" Baum arrived at that name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle, Schuyler Stanton. The novel was serialized in The Philadelphia North American in 1905, under the alternative title The Emperor's Spy , prior to its book publication. Summary Robert Harcliffe, a recent college graduate, works for his Uncle Nelson in the family's mercantile business in New Orleans. Nelson Harcliffe receives a letter from an old client in Brazil, Dom Miguel de Pintra, who is a wealthy man who has retired from business to devote himself to politics — specifically to the republican cause that hopes to end the Brazilian Empire. Dom Miguel has written to request a secretary; Robert, eager for adventure, takes the job. Robert's attitude is devil-may-care at first, yet he quickly learns that he has entered into a dangerous enterprise. He cleverly evades a murderous spy on the voyage down to Rio de Janeiro; but as soon as he reaches the city he is arrested by the police. In the carriage taking him to the police station, the lieutenant in charge is murdered by his own sergeant, who is a republican sympathizer. The sergeant and other sympathizers guide Harcliffe to Dom Miguel's plantation in Matto Grosso state. There, Harcliffe becomes a devoted admirer of de Pintra and a republican sympathizer himself. (Baum presents this as an American's natural preference, over the archaic, authoritarian, European imperial system.)  Robert also learns that the circle around Dom Miguel is fraught with uncertainty. The man's daughter Izabel is cold and hostile, while his ward Lesba is an ardent republican and a beauty with whom Harcliffe soon falls in love. Lesba'",

In contrast to Enter the Gungeon's top-down perspective, Exit the Gungeon is a sidescrolling platformer. The Gungeon has become a paradox and is collapsing! Blessed by the magic of the Sorceress, your gun will change rapidly as you ascend the Gungeon. The better you play, and the higher your combo, the more powerful the form your gun will take. Battle against the last and most bitter of the Gundead at a frantic pace, slowing down just long enough to chat with some familiar faces... and a few new ones. Shifting rooms, enemies, bosses, bizarre weapons and items all combine to ensure that no two attempts to Exit the Gungeon are the same. Exit the Gungeon is a bullet hell dungeon climber immediately following the adventures of the misfit ‘Gungeoneers’ and their journey for personal absolution in Enter the Gungeon.

Dinosaur Train is designed to help encourage basic scientific thinking and skills as the audience learns about natural science, natural history and paleontology. The computer-animated series, with animation outsourced to Singapore, consists of forty episodes. Created by Craig Bartlett, Dinosaur Train follows the adventures of a young Tyrannosaurus rex and his adoptive family of Pteranodons. The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train is customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, there’s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by Troodon s (who get to run it because they’re the smartest dinosaurs, as they often explain, and have nimble toe claws to punch the tickets). The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world—it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It also has the ability to visit the entire Mesozoic Era, the “Age of Dinosaurs,” passing through magical Time Tunnels to meet the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods. The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, the preschool-age Tyrannosaurus . In the show’s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pteranodon and brought to their nest to hatch at the same time as his siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, assisted with all dinosaur facts by the train’s Troodon Conductor, Buddy quickly learns that he is a Tyrannosaurus . As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is especially curious about the differenc",

Dinosaur Train is designed to help encourage basic scientific thinking and skills as the audience learns about natural science, natural history and paleontology. The computer-animated series, with animation outsourced to Singapore, consists of forty episodes. Created by Craig Bartlett, Dinosaur Train follows the adventures of a young Tyrannosaurus rex and his adoptive family of Pteranodons. The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train is customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, there’s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by Troodon s (who get to run it because they’re the smartest dinosaurs, as they often explain, and have nimble toe claws to punch the tickets). The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world—it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It also has the ability to visit the entire Mesozoic Era, the “Age of Dinosaurs,” passing through magical Time Tunnels to meet the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods. The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, the preschool-age Tyrannosaurus . In the show’s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pteranodon and brought to their nest to hatch at the same time as his siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, assisted with all dinosaur facts by the train’s Troodon Conductor, Buddy quickly learns that he is a Tyrannosaurus . As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is especially curious about the differenc",

The focus shifted in the spin-off sequel The Next Karate Kid , which centered around Julie Pierce ( Hilary Swank ) as she is taught to control her anger by Mr Miyagi ( Pat Morita ). The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that ran for thirteen episodes before its cancellation. In 2010, a remake of the first film was released starring Jaden Smith as the titular character Dre Parker , and Jackie Chan as kung-fu master, Mr. Han . In 2018, YouTube Premium announced a spinoff series of the franchise titled Cobra Kai , which reunites the original rivals Daniel LaRusso ( Ralph Macchio ) and Johnny Lawrence ( William Zabka ). The series currently airs on Netflix. The franchise has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and teen film narratives in America.

The focus shifted in the spin-off sequel The Next Karate Kid , which centered around Julie Pierce ( Hilary Swank ) as she is taught to control her anger by Mr Miyagi ( Pat Morita ). The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that ran for thirteen episodes before its cancellation. In 2010, a remake of the first film was released starring Jaden Smith as the titular character Dre Parker , and Jackie Chan as kung-fu master, Mr. Han . In 2018, YouTube Premium announced a spinoff series of the franchise titled Cobra Kai , which reunites the original rivals Daniel LaRusso ( Ralph Macchio ) and Johnny Lawrence ( William Zabka ). The series currently airs on Netflix. The franchise has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and teen film narratives in America.

The Karate Kid Part II Building off the success of the first film, The Karate Kid Part II was released in 1986 and once again starred Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. It introduced new characters Yukie ( Nobu McCarthy ), Kumiko ( Tamlyn Tomita ), and Chozen Toguchi ( Yuji Okumoto ), among others.

        "context": "The All-New Popeye Hour or The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show or The All-New Popeye Show or Popeye: The Continuing Adventures is a television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and King Features Syndicate , which originally aired on the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983. The show stars Popeye , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian sailor clothes, abandoning the white Navy uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show, Popeye the Sailor (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics). Bluto was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed Brutus as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away. The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series, Dinky Dog , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time Jack Mercer voiced Popeye before his death.

        "context": "Spinach is a leafy vegetable with a high vitamin content, making it a healthy and nutritious food for human consumption. In most media featuring Popeye , it is used as a last-minute device in which the hero, in danger, pulls out a can of spinach from his shirt or otherwise acquires the vegetable and eats it. This gives his already extraordinary strength a tremendous boost, helping him withstand his enemies' attacks and all kinds of adverse situations. This did not initially exist in Segar 's comic Thimble Theatre , where Popeye originated, later simply becoming the food that Popeye favored in order to remain strong, before seeing more widespread use in post-Segar comics. Since the earliest animated cartoons, however, as produced by Fleischer Studios , it was introduced in its strength-boosting capacity and in this form would remain a staple of all of Popeye's screen incarnations. Contents 1 The hero's empowerment 2 The villain's comeuppance 3 Spinach as eaten by others 4 Extraordinary uses 5 Public views 6 Notes The hero's empowerment The animated cartoons more notedly adhere to a format in which spinach is Popeye's main means for overcoming the greatest of obstacles. Even if the cartoon acknowledges Popeye's immense strength to begin with (later ones from the Famous era make him much weaker before spinach), consumption of the vegetable augments Popeye's physical might to the extreme, allowing the viewer to enjoy a power fantasy and enabling the sailor to even break the laws of physics at times. The villain's comeuppance In Popeye's dealings with opponents such as Bluto , spinach is consumed when the sailor's well-being is threatened or Olive Oyl is on the verge of being abused. After eating the vegetable, Popeye strikes at the antagonist with his increased strength, wherein the blows can immediately render the erstwhile competitor unconscious, send him airborne to a distant destination, initiate the use of various props which serve to immobilize and otherwise humbl",

Popeye or Popeye the Sailor is a comic book series based upon Popeye and the rest of the Thimble Theatre cast, spun off from Four Color\n    ' s early Popeye editions. Begun in 1948 with story and art by Bud Sagendorf , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator E. C. Segar , the series lasted for 171 issues until 1984. At first simply titled Popeye , the publication mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as Axle and Cam or Sherm! and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip, Sappo , as the supporting feature in the book. Short text stories would also be included, as well as the later Popeye's Physical Fitness Program , with the format changing through the years. The comic eventually lengthened its title to Popeye the Sailor with issue 66 in 1962, as Gold Key Comics took the title over from Dell Publishing .

The show stars Popeye , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian sailor clothes, abandoning the white Navy uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show, Popeye the Sailor (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics). Bluto was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed Brutus as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away. The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series, Dinky Dog , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time Jack Mercer voiced Popeye before his death.

His debut novel Lucky Wander Boy attracted favorable reviews on its release in 2002. He has written a number of unproduced film screenplays, including adaptations of the Halo computer game series and of the novel Ender's Game . He is also working on the I Am Legend prequel movie. He is a long-time friend and occasional collaborator of David Benioff . Benioff asked Weiss to develop the Game of Thrones project with him for HBO. On 16 January 2007, HBO optioned the rights to the books and the two writers began developing the project as a pilot script. The two writers appeared with George R.R. Martin at an appearance on social networking site Second Life on 31 May 2007 to discuss the project with fans. On 9 September 2008, HBO exercised their option to buy the rights and ordered a pilot on 11 November, with Benioff and Weiss appointed as executive producers and showrunners of the project. On Game of Thrones Weiss works as executive producer, showrunner, and scriptwriter. Together with David Benioff he has written most of the episodes of the series to date. Starting with the third season , he has co-directed episodes with Benioff. Benioff and Weiss won the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series 2015 Emmy Award for the Season 5 finale, \" Mother's Mercy \". Speaking with Variety in April 2016, Weiss said that his favorite characters are Tyrion Lannister and Samwell Tarly . When asked which character is the most difficult for him to write, Weiss said it was also Tyrion - because he is supposed to be very witty and intelligent, his lines always require more work, because Benioff and Weiss admit they aren't as extremely witty in real life as Tyrion is supposed to be all the time within the story.

Like Season 7 , Season 8 is shorter than previous seasons, consisting of six episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces than in previous seasons. Filming for Season 8 began on October 23, 2017 and ended on July 6, 2018. It premiered on April 14, 2019 and ended on May 19, 2019. Like the sixth and seventh seasons, Season 8 is based on an outline of the two final, presently-unpublished novels in George R.R. Martin 's A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring . Although Season 8 is the final season of Game of Thrones ,\n   five potential\n   prequel projects\n   were pitched to HBO after its conclusion.\n   This resulted in a 10-episode straight-to-series order for the first prequel series, House of the Dragon , which is due to begin airing in 2022.
